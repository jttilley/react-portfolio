                    I enjoy analyzing and problem solving. I am great with math and logic and love learning new things. I got into coding when I was in middle school and have enjoyed doing it ever since. I have a heart for helping others, am a good listener, and value accuracy, honesty, and truth. I love coding because I'm able to make helpful tools and functions for myself and others and it gives me the ability to innovate unique and useful solutions for people.

                    For the last few years, I have been creating computer improvements for efficiency, error checking, and ease in every day tasks. I've made these improvments in every department for Lazer Designs, where I currently work, as well as for a few other companies. With all the changes and programs Iâ€™ve created, Iâ€™ve saved Lazer Designs 10s of 1000s of dollars in time, man power, and mistakes.

                    My creativity is not only in programming. I have also made many movies with my friends since elementary school. Over the years I've refined my skills at making and editing videos. I've even helped edit award winning documentaries and have made many training videos.

                    I have a heart for teaching others about the facinating things I've learned. Some of my favorite passtimes are playing with my kids, playing volleyball, working out, and writing about things I've learned. I would love to find a job were I can create helpful and exciting apps full time.
